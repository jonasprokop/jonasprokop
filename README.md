# Hi there, welcome to my GitHub! 👋

I’m **Jonáš Prokop**, a Data Scientist, Software Engineer, and Molecular Biologist fascinated by how structure gives rise to intelligence — whether it’s in molecules, cells, or whole neural systems.

I currently work as a Research Assistant at the Computational Systems Neuroscience Group (CSNG), Charles University (MFF UK), where I develop biologically grounded machine-learning models that connect neural computation with real cortical data.

My interests span physics, chemistry, and biology — from the dynamics of molecules and proteins to neural physiology and the machine-learning models that seek to understand them.
## Areas of Interest:

- Data Science: Extracting insights and driving decisions with data.

- Machine Learning: Building intelligent systems to solve complex problems.

- Software Development: Creating robust and scalable applications.

- Infrastructure: Supporting tools and frameworks that make it all possible.

## On this GitHub, you'll find:

- Research projects

- Machine learning experiments

- Development tools

- Contributions to open-source software

Feel free to explore and make yourself at home! 🎉
